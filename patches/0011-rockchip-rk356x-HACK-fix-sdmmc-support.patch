Subject: [PATCH 11/11] rockchip: rk356x: HACK: fix sdmmc support

HACK: lock mmc0 to initial frequency and disable dw-mmc control of power
line.

The sdmmc on quartz64-a is powered by the sdmmc0 power line, which is
active low.
Even though it is set as a gpio, it still seems to be triggered by the
dw-mmc driver toggling the power line.
Downstream fixes this by setting this to "0" instead of "1" using
kconfigs.

Also, for some reason the controller will only operate at initial
frequencies.
